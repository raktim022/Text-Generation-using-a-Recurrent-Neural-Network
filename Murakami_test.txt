When the phone rang I was in the kitchen, boiling a potrul of spaghetti and
whistling along with an FM broadcast of the overture to Rossini’s The
Thieving Magpie, which has to be the perfect music for cooking pasta.
I wanted to ignore the phone, not only because the spaghetti was nearly
done, but because Claudio Abbado was bringing the London Symphony to
its musical climax. Finally, though, I had to give in. It could have been
somebody with news of a job opening. I lowered the flame, went to the
living room, and picked up the receiver.
“Ten minutes, please,” said a woman on the other end.
I’m good at recognizing people’s voices, but this was not one I knew.
“Excuse me? To whom did you wish to speak?”
“To you, of course. Ten minutes, please. That’s all we need to understand
each other.” Her voice was low and soft but otherwise nondescript.
“Understand each other?”
“Each other’s feelings

I leaned over and peeked through the kitchen door. The spaghetti pot was
steaming nicely, and Claudio Abbado was still conducting The Thieving
Magpie.
“Sorry, but you caught me in the middle of making spaghetti. Can I ask
you to call back later?”
“Spaghetti!? What are you doing cooking spaghetti at ten-thirty in the
morning?”
“That’s none of your business,” I said. “I decide what I eat and when I
eat it.”
“True enough. I’ll call back,” she said, her voice now flat and
expressionless. A little change in mood can do amazing things to the tone of
a person’s voice.
“Hold on a minute,” I said before she could hang up. “If this is some
new sales gimmick, you can forget it. I’m out of work. I’m not in the
market for anything.”
“Don’t worry. I know.”
“You know? You know what?”
“That you’re out of work. I know about that. So go cook your precious
spaghetti.”
“Who the hell-”
She cut the connection.
With no outlet for my feelings, I stared at the phone in my hand until I
remembered the spaghetti. Back in the kitchen, I turned off the gas and
poured the contents of the pot into a colander. Thanks to the phone call, the
spaghetti was a little softer than al dente, but it had not been dealt a mortal
blow. I started eating-and thinking.

Understand each other? Understand each other’s feelings in ten minutes?
What was she talking about? Maybe it was just a prank call. Or some new
sales pitch. In any case, it had nothing to do with me.
After lunch, I went back to my library novel on the living room sofa,
glancing every now and then at the telephone. What were we supposed to
understand about each other in ten minutes? What can two people
understand about each other in ten minutes? Come to think of it, she
seemed awfully sure about those ten minutes: it was the first thing out of
her mouth. As if nine minutes would be too short or eleven minutes too
long. Like cooking spaghetti al dente.
I couldn’t read anymore. I decided to iron shirts instead. Which is what I
always do when I’m upset. It’s an old habit. I divide the job into twelve
precise stages, beginning with the collar (outer surface) and ending with the
left-hand cuff. The order is always the same, and I count off each stage to
myself. Otherwise, it won’t come out right.
I ironed three shirts, checking them over for wrinkles and putting them
on hangers. Once I had switched off the iron and put it away with the
ironing board in the hall closet, my mind felt a good deal clearer.
I was on my way to the kitchen for a glass of water when the phone rang
again. I hesitated for a second but decided to answer it. If it was the same
woman, I’d tell her I was ironing and hang up.
This time it was Kumiko. The wall clock said eleven-thirty. “How are
you?” she asked.
“Fine,” I said, relieved to hear my wife’s voice.
“What are you doing?”
“Just finished ironing.”
“What’s wrong?” There was a note of tension in her voice. She knew
what it meant for me to be ironing.

“Nothing. I was just ironing some shirts.” I sat down and shifted the
receiver from my left hand to my right. “What’s up?”
“Can you write poetry?” she asked.
“Poetry!?” Poetry? Did she mean ... poetry?
“I know the publisher of a story magazine for girls. They’re looking for
somebody to pick and revise poems submitted by readers. And they want
the person to write a short poem every month for the frontispiece. Pay’s not
bad for an easy job. Of course, it’s part-time. But they might add some
editorial work if the person-”
“Easy work?” I broke in. “Hey, wait a minute. I’m looking for something
in law, not poetry.”
“I thought you did some writing in high school.”
“Yeah, sure, for the school newspaper: which team won the soccer
championship or how the physics teacher fell down the stairs and ended up
in the hospital-that kind of stuff. Not poetry. I can’t write poetry.”
“Sure, but I’m not talking about great poetry, just something for high
school girls. It doesn’t have to find a place in literary history. You could do
it with your eyes closed. Don’t you see?”
“Look, I just can’t write poetry-eyes open or closed. I’ve never done it,
and I’m not going to start now.”
“All right,” said Kumiko, with a hint of regret. “But it’s hard to find
legal work.”
“I know. That’s why I’ve got so many feelers out. I should be hearing
something this week. If it’s no go, I’ll think about doing something else.”
“Well, I suppose that’s that. By the way, what’s today? What day of the
week?”
I thought a moment and said, “Tuesday.”
